# Architecture Decision Records

This directory collects Architecture Decision Records, as outlined by Michael Nygard in his article: http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions

Architecture (understood widely) decisions should be documented in the ADR format.

A template for this repository is provided here: @subpage adr_nnnn

ADRs related to possible changes, superseded or any other outdated decisions should NOT be removed from the directory.
Superseding decisions should reference ADRs they're changing or overriding.
